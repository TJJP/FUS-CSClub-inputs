# Four is Cosmic
This one requires special rules - there could be confusion as to how to get a word from a number.
The rules:
 - Hyphenation doesn't matter, a space and a hypen are both one character.
 - You do not have to handle negative numbers.
 - You do not have to handle triple digit numbers or beyond. Four is Cosmic trends steeply downwards above the low teens 
anyway, so this shouldn't be a problem.

Given a number, print the next numbers and then COSMIC when appropriate. Example:
```
12
6
3
5
4
COSMIC
```
