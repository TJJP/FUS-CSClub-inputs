# Numerical Sort
The first number is how many numbers you have to sort. Easy to say, hard to do (fast).
All numbers are 32-bit signed integers, because some languages have subpar experiences with longs.
Example:
```
12
7
35
-63
-7
27
82
8
28
92
47
2
6
```
becomes
```
12
-63
-7
2
6
7
8
27
28
35
47
82
92
```
